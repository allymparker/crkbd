# Corneroll - Wireless Choc Hotswap with Nice!View support and dual encoders

[ZMK Firmware fork](https://github.com/allymparker/zmk/tree/allymparker/corneroll)
[ZMK Config](https://github.com/allymparker/zmk-config-unified)

## Motivation
- I love the Corne form factor
- Want bluetooth
- Want Nice!View with no monkey patching
- Love the Ultralight, but want Hotswap
  - Want the On/Off switch
  - Want the JST connector
- Wanted to try out EVQWGD001 encoders

## Build Notes

Put it together exactly like any other Corne.

NOTE: To get the encoders to fit snugly and closer to the height of the keys, I needed to trim the plastic lip/legs off the bottom.
